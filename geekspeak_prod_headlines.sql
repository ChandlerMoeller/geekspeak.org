The change in air pressure associated with a sonic boom is only a few pounds per square foot -- about the same pressure change experienced riding an elevator down two or three floors. It is the rate of change, the sudden onset of the pressure change, that makes the sonic boom audible, NASA said.   All aircraft generate two cones, at the nose and at the tail. They are usually of similar strength and the time interval between the two as they reach the ground is primarily dependent on the size of the aircraft and its altitude. Most people on the ground cannot distinguish between the two and they are usually heard as a single sonic boom.

Keeping Your Journal Safe
Recently some journals and communities have been broken into, their contents deleted, and their owners locked out. We want to explain how this can happen and give you some steps you can take to help prevent this from happening to your journal or community.

First of all, we would like to dispel the rumor that these break-ins have something to do with the accounts that have recently been friending large numbers of users (sometimes called friending bots). We do not believe these are related. The problem appears to stem from Hotmail''s policy of recycling inactive email addresses.

The recent break-ins resulted from hijackers finding and accessing lapsed Hotmail accounts that were used with LiveJournal accounts and publicly displayed on Profile pages in the past. You should be aware that Hotmail recycles email addresses that haven''t been used in more than a year. If you validated a Hotmail address for your journal and displayed it publicly in the past, but then let the address lapse, someone who finds and re-registers that address can use it to obtain control of the journal.

This way, it could surprise and apprehend its target before it can get away.

Creepy as this might sound, a team at Seoul National University in Korea has created an algorithm that models just this sort of stealthy behavior. Professor of engineering Beom Lee and first author Jung-Hee Park designed simulations in which a robot waits in the shadows and moves quickly between obstacles to intercept a target.

The simulations take into account the size of the robot, the size of objects it can hide behind and the speeds of moving target. In the videos below, the robot, blue, tracks the invader, red. The blue line marks the robot''s planned path and its projected interception point.

And last month, the city signed a $99,570 deal with Afax Business Machines in Manhattan for the maintenance of its existing Brother, Panasonic and IBM Selectric typewriters.', 'on', 'http://www.nypost.com/seven/07132009/news/regionalnews/typewrite__wrong_178919.htm');

Talk to your Pekoppa plant and it responds to your voice by bending and moving in a very lifelike manner (if real plants could move, which they mostly don''t). Ignore it and it gets pretty sad. The more you talk, the happier it is... making it the ideal companion for your wife or girlfriend. ', 'on', 'http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/japanfan/ac8d/');

Touchable holographic display uses hacked Wiimotes

Many respected engineers have been trying for years to bring a compressed air car to market, believing strongly that compressed air can power a viable "zero pollution" car. Now the first commercial compressed air car is on the verge of production and beginning to attract a lot of attention, and with a recently signed partnership with Tata, India''s largest automotive manufacturer, the prospects of very cost-effective mass production are now a distinct possibility. The MiniC.A.T is a simple, light urban car, with a tubular chassis that is glued not welded and a body of fibreglass. The heart of the electronic and communication system on the car is a computer offering an array of information reports that extends well beyond the speed of the vehicle, and is built to integrate with external systems and almost anything you could dream of, starting with voice recognition, internet connectivity, GSM telephone connectivity, a GPS guidance system, fleet management systems, emergency systems, and of course every form of digital entertainment. The engine is fascinating, as is and the revolutionary electrical system that uses just one cable and so is the vehicle''s wireless control system.

Archaeologists have unearthed a new stone circle near Stonehenge that lends credence to the theory that the famous prehistoric monument in Britain was part of a funeral complex.

University of Bristol archaeologist Joshua Pollard described the new find as "incredible" because it establishes Stonehenge as part of a larger ceremonial complex linked to the nearby River Avon.

From the data gathered from 15,000 experiments in rat somatosensory cortex, it became possible to begin constructing a model of this part of the brain.', 'new', 'http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/');

"Robots are not just things the manufacturer builds and you go out and use them in a specific way. Robots can often be instructed, they can be programmed, you can have software that is built upon by others," he said.

There are no laws in the U.S. specifically governing robots, and discussion of them usually leads to science fiction writer Isaac Asimov''s Three Laws of Robotics, which debuted in his 1942 short story "Runaround."

The first of Asimov''s laws is that robots should do no harm. It''s also one of the biggest considerations when manufacturing the next generation of personal robots.

"If a robot becomes increasingly autonomous and can make its own decisions, what happens if the robot does not carry out the exact wishes of the person?" said George Bekey, a robotics researcher and professor emeritus at University of Southern California.

As robots interact more closely with people, the bonds some people form with the machines -- even ones that do not look like humans -- might need to be considered.

Shoppers personalize their Roombas, naming and decorating them, for example. Angle recalled an incident when a soldier plucked a banged-up military robot nicknamed Scooby from an Iraqi battlefield and carried it to a depot to be fixed.

"It''s doing you a service, you''re going to get attached to it," Angle said.

Ronald Arkin teaches a course on robots and society at Georgia Tech and directs the school''s Mobile Robot Laboratory. His most recent book is titled "Governing Lethal Behavior in Autonomous Robots."

"There needs to be ethics embedded in the systems," he said. "It''s not just making a system that assists someone. It''s making a system that interacts with someone in a way that respects their dignity."

Horvitz said his panel will recommend more research into the psychological reactions humans have to robotic systems. The group, he said, also suggests machines be designed with the ability to explain their reasoning to humans.

While ethicists, lawyers and roboticists ponder how to best integrate humans and autonomous machines, there is some evidence that a balance is already beginning to be struck.

After returning to the Stanford hospital on another occasion, Horvitz noticed a sign hanging above the spot where he had his harrowing experience. It read: "Please Do Not Board The Elevator With The Robot." ', 'new', 'http://www.sltrib.com/business/ci_13921446');

This is described as a modular upgrade for parachute systems for use in “high-altitude, high-opening” jump missions, typically carried out by Special Forces.

In case you don''t know what a pico projector is, as its name implies, it''s a miniature handheld projector that''s capable of casting a big image (WowWee says the Cinemin Swivel can project an image from 8 inches to 50 inches). The key to these pint-size projectors is that they use an LED light source that''s very energy efficient. Pico projectors come in different shapes and sizes; most cost between $300 and $400, and they currently sport resolutions up to 640x480 pixels, though the Cinemin Swivel only offers 480x320 pixels or HVGA resolution. This model uses DLP technology for projecting an image. That''s the same technology employed in many rear-projection TVs, but projected on an external wall, movie-theater-style, instead of the backside of a TV screen.

The Cinemin Swivel is similar in size to competing pico projectors, but the 3M MPro120 is slightly smaller and more compact. Weighing in at 6.4 ounces and measuring 5 inches by 3 inches by 8.5 inches, the Swivel model does indeed fit in a pocket (or easily slips in a laptop bag) and comes with a protective sleeve.

SAN JOSE (CBS 5) ―

    Some people of Asian descent complain the "Blink Proof" feature is activated when their eyes are open.

When Nikon released its Coolpix S630 camera last year, it came with a feature called "Blink Proof," which should warn if the person in the photo has their eyes closed. But one woman and others who are of Asian descent say they have triggered the warning with their eyes open.

Joz Wang made headlines with a blog post about the camera titled, "Racist Camera! No, I didn''t blink…I''m just Asian!" CBS 5 tested the Japanese-made device and it gave blink warnings on four out of six subjects, most of whom were Asian. Nikon said they haven''t received any complaints and suggested turning off the feature if it is not working.

You could just plot a route directly to your planned destination, but that would mean traversing the badlands between the Milky Way''s spiral arms that contain few stars (and, presumably, few interstellar gas stations) than if you followed the curving arms.

If you own a dog or a cat then there''s a good chance you''ve spent hours with a camera trying -- and probably failing -- to get a perfect picture of them. Now, technology is coming to the rescue.

FujiFilm''s Finepix Z700 features a face-detection function that can recognize canine and feline faces, and it can snap a picture automatically when they look towards the camera lens.

There is one pet photography problem FujiFilm says its new camera can''t solve: "Dogs or cats that are constantly in motion cannot be recognized."

It is demonstrating the animal face recognition feature at this week''s Camera and Photo Imaging Show in Yokohama, Japan, albeit with stuffed toy dogs and cats. It works just like face detection does with a human. When it finds a face, a green box is drawn around it on screen and the camera automatically focuses.

Since it is capable of cycling from a mature adult stage to an immature polyp stage and back again, there may be no natural limit to its life span. Scientists say the hydrozoan jellyfish is the only known animal that can repeatedly turn back the hands of time and revert to its polyp state (its first stage of life).

The key lies in a process called transdifferentiation, where one type of cell is transformed into another type of cell. Some animals can undergo limited transdifferentiation and regenerate organs, such as salamanders, which can regrow limbs. Turritopsi nutricula, on the other hand, can regenerate its entire body over and over again. Researchers are studying the jellyfish to discover how it is able to reverse its aging process.

Because they are able to bypass death, the number of individuals is spiking. They''re now found in oceans around the globe rather than just in their native Caribbean waters.  "We are looking at a worldwide silent invasion," says Dr. Maria Miglietta of the Smithsonian Tropical Marine Institute.

* Change your font!

From creation to composting, EcoCradle™ packaging fit into nature''s recycling program. The materials that go into EcoCradle™ are all naturally occurring waste products, like buckwheat hulls, rice hulls, or cotton burrs. Our production process harnesses the natural ability of our organism to self assemble lignin and cellulose into strong bio-composites. Because we grow materials without lots of heat, pressure or petroleum, our process is extremely energy efficient. And once you’re done with an EcoCradle™ packaging buffer, it can be used as mulch in your garden, composted or even thrown away.

All natural ingredients
Unlike synthetic materials such as expanded polystyrene that are made from oil or natural gas, EcoCradle™ is all natural. It is comprised of local agricultural byproducts such as cotton seed hulls and buckwheat hulls. We strive to utilize agricultural wastes that have almost no value. We avoid agricultural byproducts that can be used for livestock feed, and because we focus on materials that are high in lignin, they typically can’t be used in a cellulosic ethanol processes. The raw material inputs of EcoCradle™ are selected based on regionally available agricultural by-products. So a factory in Texas or China might use cotton seed hulls, and a factory in Virginia or Spain might use rice husks and soybean hulls. By manufacturing regionally, and using local feedstocks, we aim to minimize the trucking of raw and finished materials. ', 'on', 'http://ecovativedesign.com/ecocradle/environment/');

The content often consists of a saying or joke, a rumor, an altered or original image, a complete website, a video clip or animation, or an offbeat news story, among many other possibilities. In simple terms, an Internet meme is an inside joke, that a large number of Internet users are in on. An Internet meme may stay the same or may evolve over time, by chance or through commentary, imitations, and parody versions, or even by collecting news accounts about itself. Internet memes have a tendency to evolve and spread extremely quickly, sometimes going in and out of popularity in just days. They are spread organically, voluntarily, and peer to peer, rather than by compulsion, predetermined path, or completely automated means. The term "Meme" was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 pop-science bestseller, The Selfish Gene.[2]

The term may refer to the content that spreads from user to user, the idea behind the content, or the phenomenon of its spread. Internet memes have been seen as a form of art.[3]', 'on', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme_(Internet)');

Adam was a technical writer who founded a publishing company to publish crucial information about microprocessors and software that was sorely lacking at the time, which was eventually sold to McGraw-Hill. He became a controversial columnist, opining on the industry from his pulpit in InfoWorld and other publications. He had a populist vision of computing, touting a no-frills, low cost, high volume approach to the business.

In 1980, he decided to put his theories into practice, and founded the Osborne Computer Company to design, manufacture and market the Osborne 1, which was a low cost, one-piece, portable computer complete with a suite of bundled applications. He recruited Lee Felsenstein, already a microcomputing legend as the master of ceremonies of the Home Brew Computer Club, to design the hardware. Now, they were introducing the fruits of their labor at the West Coast Computer Faire, as Apple had done four years earlier.

Perhaps Adobe should focus more on creating great HTML5 tools for the future, and less on criticizing Apple for leaving the past behind."

Jobs also knocked Flash for being proprietary, sapping battery power, not supporting multitouch interfaces, posing security risks, and being unstable. "Flash is the No. 1 reason Macs crash," Jobs said.

Pre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company''s future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal as the revenue drop for the current product is replaced by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available.

The Osborne effect occurs when this pre-announcement is made either unaware of the risks involved or when the timing is misjudged. Customers react immediately by canceling or deferring orders for the current product, knowing that it will soon be obsolete. Inventories increase and the company must react by either discounting or lowering production of the current product. Either of these choices depresses cash flow. In the software industry the Osborne effect can also lead to an increase in sales of current generation hardware if it is upgradeable. In the actual case of Osborne Computer Corporation, the company took more than a year to make its next product available. It ran out of cash and went bankrupt in 1985.[1][2]

Pre-announcing products in a way that incurs the Osborne effect is an example of a self-defeating prophecy, as the announcement of the new product is ultimately responsible for its own abandonment. At the very least, any unexpected delays may mean the new product comes to be perceived as vaporware, further damaging the company''s credibility and thus profitability.', 'on', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect');

Och spent the last six years developing Google Translate, a translation program, at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, "and so far I''ve never really used it myself," Och admits.

The idea that “short kids have social problems,” as Mr. Schwartz puts it, is largely a myth, eagerly embraced by makers of human growth hormone.

“When Eli Lilly was telling the government that it should be allowed to sell its growth hormone to kids who were simply small,” he writes, “it presented studies that supposedly showed that short kids are prone to teasing and bullying and ‘exclusion’ and they suffer from ‘social isolation’ and a ‘perception of lower competence.’ ”

But David E. Sandberg, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, reports that “short kids actually cope pretty well with being small.” In a study of hundreds of children in the Buffalo area, Dr. Sandberg found there was no real problem with being short and “there is little benefit to being tall.”

Summarizing the research, Mr. Schwartz writes: “Height didn’t affect the number of friends the kids had, or the height of those friends. It had nothing to do with how well students were liked by others, what the others thought of them, or even of their own perception of their reputation within the school.” ', 'new', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/health/11brod.html');

Instead of buying a phone from a carrier, with a contract and a subsidized up-front cost, the company was hoping to cut out the network. Customers would buy the phone directly from Google, paying the full fee up-front, and then putting in a SIM of their choice.

This, however, ignored the realities of the phone market, as the company soon discovered. Its approach to tech support—send an e-mail and maybe get an answer eventually—was always doomed to failure.

always has to push it. Not content with big ol'' Frankenstein-complex robots that have started building our cars and mimicking our women, some of our greatest minds have been busy creating molecular-level robots that can tool around inside the human body. So cue the dramatic music, and enter the DNA spider.

Originally created by Milan N. Stojanovic from Columbia University, this Spider robot, made entirely out of DNA and scotch tape, has been upgraded from its initial version by a team of researchers from schools like Caltech, Columbia, Arizona State, and the University of Michigan. It can now walk up to 100 nanometers unaided by using one of its biotin-labelled DNA legs to bind to and then cut itself from a trail of DNA "bread crumbs", located on what has been dubbed "DNA origami", though you''ll find few cranes and sailing-ship designs here.

This distance doesn''t sound like much, since every time you twitch with laughter at the clever wit of the blog post you''re reading, you''re moving hundreds of millions of nanometers, but its a big deal in the nano-world. Previous DNA robots could only move five or ten nanometers before crapping out, so this is alot like seeing your first child actually make it across the room on two feet without smacking headfirst into the coffee table.

With the pending closure of Google''s Nexus One online store, a smartphone revolution is in tatters. Google still has a killer product in Android, but the Nexus One''s online-only business model, meant to disrupt the way phones are typically sold, is a failure.

Google wants the Nexus One in more retail stores around the world, which means it''ll have to make nice with wireless carriers. So what if Google was selling unsubsidized phones as an alternative to two-year carrier contracts? The idea didn''t take off, so no harm, no foul.

This additional weight accommodates the structure and equipment necessary for compliance with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) which are not found in other Light Sport Aircraft. Items such as airbags, an energy absorbing crumple zone, and a protective safety cage will increase safety both on the road and in the air. Exclusively applicable to the Transition ® , the FAA''s grant of an additional 110 pounds will allow a competitive useful load while providing a revolutionary level of crash safety in a Light Sport Aircraft.

By giving pilots a convenient ground transportation option, the Transition ® reduces the cost, inconvenience, and weather sensitivity of personal aviation. In addition to the enhanced protection afforded by applying automotive crash safety technology to light planes, the Transition ® reduces the potential for an accident by allowing pilots to drive under bad weather instead of potentially flying into marginal conditions.

Classified as a Light Sport Aircraft, the Transition ® requires a Sport Pilot certificate to fly and is designed to drive on public roadways and park in a standard garage. Terrafugia successfully completed flight and drive testing of its Proof of Concept Transition ® in 2009. Refundable airframe reservations are being accepted with first delivery scheduled for late 2011.

She was evasive, for one thing. When I asked what it was like being a robot, she said she wanted a playmate — but declined to elaborate.

“Are you lonely?” I pressed.

“What do you want to talk about?” she replied.

Other times, she wouldn’t let me get a word in edgewise. A simple question about her origins prompted a seemingly endless stream-of-consciousness reply. Something about robotic world domination and gardening; I couldn’t follow.

Paro is a robot modeled after a baby harp seal. It trills and paddles when petted, blinks when the lights go up, opens its eyes at loud noises and yelps when handled roughly or held upside down. Two microprocessors under its artificial white fur adjust its behavior based on information from dozens of hidden sensors that monitor sound, light, temperature and touch. It perks up at the sound of its name, praise and, over time, the words it hears frequently. ', 'new', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/05/science/05robot.html?emc=tnt&tntemail0=y');

It has 14 electrodes (as opposed to NeuroSky''s single-electrode and OCZ''s three-electrode headsets) and it can also detect head movement using a built-in gyroscope. The EPOC uses its sensors to detect changes in electrical activity using EEG monitoring techniques that let it detect facial gestures and estimate roughly relative mood states.

Emotiv''s intent with the EPOC is to add a whole new dimension to videogames and other software applications that can''t be done with other PC input devices.

Applications of 3D Technology

The entertainment society has discovered their future lies in 3D movies. In fact the whole media has decided to take a deep step in the 3D picture entertainment. The sky company of Europe has already launched its first 3D channel in this field. ESPN channel will pull up its 3D television service likely at the end of this month. In the other part of the world, a group of South Korean scientists have already started their research on producing 3D books lately. so there is 3D movies ,3D pictures,3D channels,3D TV ,3D books etc...The matter has reached this far, it won’t take long for the smart phones to control the 3D field.

Most people believe it is a synonym for herbal or natural remedies.

I encounter many patients and people with these false assumptions, and they are often shocked to learn the truth about homeopathy.

We need to have an open and transparent discussion in our society about homeopathy. The science has spoken – homeopathy is a failed belief system that has no place in modern health care. It is also a great example of the dangers of allowing a system of medicine that is based upon pseudoscience to flourish. Such systems will never limit themselves to “harmless” symptomatic treatments.

Given the evidence and the state of the science, the only responsible position is to completely dismantle homeopathy and close the door on this pseudoscience once and for all.

Professor Sirikulchayanonta and her colleagues found vegetable intake doubled and the types of vegetables the children consumed increased from two to four. Parents also reported their children talked about vegetables more often and were proud they had eaten them in their school lunch.

Though this had a sample size of 26 children, so you should take it with a grain of salt.', 'on', 'http://www.medicaldaily.com/news/20100806/964/new-research-childrens-vegetable-intake-linked-to-popeye-cartoons.htm');

First, absinthe is a highly alcoholic drink, traditionally made with wormwood, anise, and other herbs. The drink was popular with artists in the late 19th century (although it saw a resurgence in the 1990s), and some versions are hallucinogenic. It tastes vaguely licorice-like. Absinthe originated as a medicinal elixir, but because of its high alcohol content it was usually diluted with cold water in order to make it easier to drink and to mute the strong taste. That''s where absinthe spoons come in.

The spoons are usually slotted; a cube or lump of sugar is placed on the spoon and water poured over it. The ritual preparation of the drink is key to enjoying it, and the spoons themselves can be incredibly elaborate and are often hand-crafted.


The delightfully absurd USB Absinthe Spoon functions no real purpose when it''s connected to a computer, but it''s made quite a splash anyway. Its creators have invited comments on their site from anyone who wants one, and the person (or people, now that they''ve had such a tremendous response) who makes the best case for owning it will win it. So far, 454 people want the spoon enough to provide a reason; a larger run of the already popular spoons is in the making. ', 'on', 'http://www.gearlog.com/2007/03/the_usb_absinthe_spoon.php');

A radioactive rabbit was trapped on the Hanford nuclear reservation, but there is no sign any people were exposed to the animal.

Washington state Health Department workers with the Office of Radiation Protection have been searching for contaminated rabbit droppings. None have been found in areas accessible to the public, regional director Earl Fordham said Thursday.

In June 2008, on a flight home from Europe to San Francisco, I was given a fascinating demo of some jaw-dropping technology.

I was sitting next Inon Beracha, CEO of Israeli company PrimeSense, which had developed a low-cost chip and software to do 3D machine vision.

The system used a pair of cameras and an infrared sensor to highlight people and track their movements.

On his laptop, Beracha showed me videos of people waving their hands in the air to control Wii-like games. He showed people controlling TV programming menus by gesturing their hands in the air. And, most impressive of all, someone flipping through a photo slide show like they were Tom Cruise in Minority Report. It was so slick, I asked him if it was CGI. It was real, he said, and so cheap, the technology could eventually be found everywhere in the home, office and car.

Of course, PrimeSense’s system is at the heart of Microsoft’s new Kinect game controller, which is getting rave reviews and looks set to be a monster hit. It’s a “crazy, magical, omigosh rush,” says the New York Times‘ David Pogue.

And it almost belonged to Apple.', 'on', 'http://www.cultofmac.com/how-apple-almost-got-microsofts-kinect-game-controller/67951');

The lights will transmit data to specially equipped computers on desks below by flickering faster than the eye can see. Ultimately, the technique could ease wireless congestion by opening up new expressways for short-range communications.
The first few light fixtures built by LVX System, a local startup, will be installed Wednesday in six municipal buildings in this city of 66,000 in the snowy farm fields of central Minnesota.
The LVX system puts clusters of its light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, in a standard-sized light fixture. The LEDs transmit coded messages -- as a series of 1s and 0s in computer speak -- to special modems attached to computers.
A light on the modem talks back to the fixture overhead, where there is sensor to receive the return signal and transmit the data over the Internet.

In the Apple Support Site, Apple notes that the "Screen Lock" function:

    Allows you to set a 4-digit combination to prevent someone else from using your iPod while it is not attached to a computer. When an iPod is locked, you must enter the combination to unlock the screen. This feature is different from the Hold switch in that the Hold switch only prevents iPod from turning on accidentally -- not keeping snoops out.

    Screen Lock only locks users out of the user interface. It does not encrypt data on your iPod.

In the study, she performed two "point-and-click" tasks each day by thinking about moving the cursor with her hand. In both tasks she averaged greater than 90 percent accuracy.

The first word flashed on the computer screen so quickly that the person didn’t realize they’d seen it. The second word appeared for longer; the person was supposed to hit a key indicating whether it was a real word as quickly as possible. This was just a test to see how quickly they were processing the word.

The trick was this: Although everything in the test was in English, in some cases, the two words actually had a connection – but only if you know how they’re written in Chinese. So, for example, the first word might be “thing,” which is written 东西in Chinese, and the second might be “west,” which is written 西in Chinese. The character for “west” appears in the word “thing,” but these two words are totally unrelated in English.

Zhang found that, when two words shared characters in Chinese, participants processed the second word faster – even though they had no conscious knowledge of having seen the first word in the pair. Even though these students are fluent in English, their brains still automatically translate what they see into Chinese. This suggests that knowledge of a first language automatically influences the processing of a second language, even when they are very different, unrelated languages.', 'on', 'http://www.healthcanal.com/public-health-safety/18014-Fluent-English-Speakers-Translate-into-Chinese-Automatically.html');

While the technology is still not exactly Skynet material, University of Pennsylvania’s Modlab foambot is an extremely interesting working concept capable of deploying itself with modular robot components, and practically assemble a new bot on the spot depending on the task it needs to perform.

A bunch of roboting parts, like actuators, are lined in a particular order depending on the type of contraption you need to assemble, after which the foambot comes along and sprays foam, which hardens and allows the new robot to come into a new moving shape. The foam is a simple commercially available material, able to expand 20 times its own size. It might not look like much, but in future variations it might prove to be indispensible for certain applications.

Almost all of today’s robots are designed for serving a particular task, however with this kind of tech, after a few tweaks to build a more practical variant, you could basically deploy bots cattering for a bunch of different situations. The foambot would definitely be very much welcomed in applications where there are numerous unpredictable environmental parameters, like space exploration or search and rescue.

Check out the self-deploying robot, developed by a team lead by Shai Revzen, in two seperate instances, one as a snake like narrow robot, the other as a quadruped bot, in the videos right below.', 'new', 'http://www.zmescience.com/research/technology/foambot-can-build-new-robots-on-the-spot-video/');

The breakthrough is a different type of sensor that captures what are known as light fields — basically, all the light that is moving in all directions in the view of the camera. That offers several advantages over traditional photography, the most revolutionary of which is that photos no longer need to be focused before they are taken.

When air had become completely phlogisticated it would no longer serve to support combustion of any material, nor would a metal heated in it yield a calx; nor could phlogisticated air support life, for the role of air in respiration was to remove the phlogiston from the body."

Thus, phlogiston was described in a way that was basically the opposite of the role of oxygen in combustion.

Joseph Black''s student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen in 1772 and the pair used the theory to explain his results. The residue of air left after burning, in fact a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, was sometimes referred to as "phlogisticated air", having taken up all of the phlogiston. Conversely, when oxygen was first discovered it was thought to be "dephlogisticated air", capable of combining with more phlogiston and thus supporting combustion for longer than ordinary air.', 'on', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory');

Nice, but not enough to claim a discovery.

Today that all changed. Two different detectors at the LHC both independently found a strong signal between 125 and 126 GeV at about the 5 sigma level – that means they can claim a 99.9999% confidence this signal is real! This means they found a previously undiscovered particle which, as it happens, is within the range of mass the Standard Model predicts for the Higgs particle!

The system uses a digital projector to illuminate raindrops for several milliseconds while a camera mounted on the side of the projector captures each raindrop''s location; software predicts where those raindrops will fall within the driver''s field of view. Light rays from the headlight that would normally hit the raindrop are automatically switched off, reducing glare and leaving only the beams of light which travel uninterrupted in between the falling drops.

The system''s operating range is three to four meters in front of the projector—the "critical range" at which glare is most distracting, according to tests conducted using a Toyota Prius.', 'on', 'http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428353/smart-headlights-see-through-rain-and-snow/');

The pyrotechnics are launched from five barges in the San Diego Bay, and this year''s show – the 12th annual spectacle – was advertised by the port as being "bigger and more intense than in past years," and organizers set up free buses and shuttles to handle the crowds of spectators. About a dozen bayside hotels offer special Fourth of July rates just so customers can watch the show from the comfort of their rooms.', 'on', 'http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/07/entire-san-diego-fireworks-show-exploded-in-15-seconds-ruining-show.html');
