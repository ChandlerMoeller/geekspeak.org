The new GeekSpeak.org site - allows the creation of episodes, episodes have participants and segments.
Segments have bits.
A bit is a title, a link, and content.

Segments can be ordered within the episode.
Bits can be ordered within segments.

I am currently working moving to test-driven development and am using ...To run testing with gaurd in it's own terminal (using the correct rvm)
 'bundle exec guard'


Curently this is simply an Active Admin beast.

On the list of todo items:

* Move to jRuby (currently does not work do to incompatablity with v8 for LESS)
* Allow for linking existing bits to a segment instead of having to create new bits every time.
* In general I need to move away from Active Admin so that the whole site works better.
